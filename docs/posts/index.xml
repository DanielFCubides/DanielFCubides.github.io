      <description>The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for software design and architecture, aimed at making software systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were promoted by Robert C. Martin in his book &amp;ldquo;Clean Architecture,&amp;rdquo; and they are widely accepted in the software development community. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of each principle:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&amp;rdquo; by Patrick Lencioni presents a unique approach to understanding and overcoming common pitfalls faced by teams.
Absence of Trust: This foundational dysfunction is where team members are not open with each other about their mistakes and weaknesses. It leads to a lack of vulnerability-based trust, which is crucial for building a strong team. Fear of Conflict: Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas.</description>

      <description>The rol of a software Architect or a tech lead may vary slightly in different organizations, generally encompass a range of duties focused on guiding the development and maintenance of software systems. These roles should docus on:
Defining and Maintaining the Overall Architecture: The primary responsibility of a software architect or tech lead is to define the software&amp;rsquo;s architecture. This involves deciding on the software&amp;rsquo;s structure, its components, and how these components interact with each other.</description>
