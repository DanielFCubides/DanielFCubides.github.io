These principles were promoted by Robert C. Martin in his book &ldquo;Clean Architecture,&rdquo; and they are widely accepted in the software development community. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of each principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should only have one job or responsibility. By following SRP, the software becomes easier to implement and less prone to bugs, as each class or module has a clear purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open/Closed Principle (OCP): According to this principle, software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code, which is often achieved through the use of interfaces or abstract classes. This principle promotes the use of a stable, well-defined interface that other components can implement or inherit from, allowing for easy expansion without changing existing code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes. This principle is fundamental for achieving polymorphism in object-oriented programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The Interface Segregation Principle advocates for small, client-specific interfaces instead of large, general-purpose ones. In practice, this means no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This principle helps in reducing the side effects and frequency of required changes by segregating interfaces in such a way that they are not bloated with methods that are not required by their implementing classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions. This leads to a decoupling of software modules, allowing high-level modules to remain insulated from changes in low-level modules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying these principles helps in creating software architectures that are more modular, scalable, and maintainable, ultimately leading to higher-quality software products.</p>
