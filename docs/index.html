<ol>
<li>Absence of Trust: This foundational dysfunction is where team members are not open with each other about their mistakes and weaknesses. It leads to a lack of vulnerability-based trust, which is crucial for building a strong team.</li>
<li>Fear of Conflict: Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. Instead, they resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments.</li>
<li>Lack of Commitment: Without having aired their opinions in the course of passionate and open debate, team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign agreement during meetings.</li>
<li>Avoidance of Accountability: Due to the lack of commitment and buy-in, team members are often hesitant to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the team&rsquo;s good health.</li>
<li>Inattention to Results: Failure to hold one another accountable leads to team members putting their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.</li>

<p>In the rapidly evolving world of software development, the debate between microservices and monolithic architectures is more relevant than ever. Drawing insights from Sam Newman&rsquo;s seminal works, &ldquo;Building Microservices&rdquo; and &ldquo;Monolith to Microservices,&rdquo; and incorporating theories from Martin Fowler, this post aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of both architectures, providing software professionals and enthusiasts with the knowledge needed to navigate these complex landscapes.</p>

        <div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">
          <p>The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for software design and architecture, aimed at making software systems more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were promoted by Robert C. Martin in his book &ldquo;Clean Architecture,&rdquo; and they are widely accepted in the software development community. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of each principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should only have one job or responsibility. By following SRP, the software becomes easier to implement and less prone to bugs, as each class or module has a clear purpose.</p>
