The rol of a software Architect or a tech lead may vary slightly in different organizations, generally encompass a range of duties focused on guiding the development and maintenance of software systems. These roles should docus on:

1. Defining and Maintaining the Overall Architecture: The primary responsibility of a software architect or tech lead is to define the software's architecture. This involves deciding on the software's structure, its components, and how these components interact with each other. They ensure that the architecture supports the business goals and is aligned with best practices and design principles, like SOLID principles.

2. Ensuring Quality and Clean Code: They are responsible for ensuring that the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and adheres to the predefined architectural standards. This involves code reviews, setting coding standards, and making sure that the development team follows these standards.

3. Technical Decision Making: A software architect or tech lead makes key technical decisions. This includes choosing technologies, frameworks, and tools that will be used in the project. They need to balance the immediate needs of a project with long-term sustainability and scalability.

4. Balancing Stakeholder Interests: They act as a bridge between the technical team and other stakeholders (like business executives, clients, and users). It's their job to translate business requirements into technical solutions and to communicate the implications of architectural decisions back to stakeholders.

5. Mentorship and Guidance: Part of their role is to mentor and guide developers. This involves sharing knowledge, promoting best practices, and helping team members grow their technical skills.

6. Risk Management: They are responsible for identifying technical risks in the project and devising strategies to mitigate these risks. This includes dealing with issues like technical debt, scalability challenges, and security vulnerabilities.

7. Adapting to Change: A key aspect of their role is to ensure that the architecture is flexible and adaptable enough to accommodate changes in business requirements, technology, and other external factors.

8. Ensuring Performance and Scalability: They must design systems that not only meet current needs but are also scalable and performant under future demands.

9. Overseeing the Development Process: While they may not be directly involved in day-to-day coding, they oversee the development process, ensuring that it aligns with the architectural vision and the project's timelines.

10. Continuous Learning and Improvement: The tech world is constantly evolving, and a good software architect or tech lead stays updated with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in software development.
